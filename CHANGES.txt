MetadataAPI: version history

1.5.0 (May 2015)
----------------
* Fixed an [issue](https://trac.mpi.nl/ticket/4624) that caused child components
and elements in metadata instances to disappear on write.

1.4.0 (December 2014)
---------------------
* Fixed reading of vocabulary
* LocalURI attribute on resource proxies
* Location in references (ResourceProxy in CMDI implementation) now stored and
accessed as URI. No automatic resolution against the document location takes
places anymore.

1.3 (August 2014)
-----------------
* Adjusted the method that sets the handle. Now, when null is passed as the 
handle, the self handle (in the header information) will be removed from the 
file.
